# 🚀 Introduction
This space is dedicated to **SQL injections**. I'll gradually add more exercises to help anyone who wants to improve their skills on this topic.  

After each challenge, you will retrieve a flag like `HackUTT{README}` that confirms you have solved it.

# 📖 Principle  
First of all, **what is a SQL injection?**  
It occurs when a user's input is not properly prepared, allowing us to inject arbitrary SQL queries that will be executed by the server. Using these queries, you might be able to:  
- Bypass authentication without a password  
- Leak information from databases  
- Read and write files on the server
